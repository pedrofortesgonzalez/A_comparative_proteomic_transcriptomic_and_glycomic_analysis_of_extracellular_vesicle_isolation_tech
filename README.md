# Glycosylation Analysis in Extracellular Vesicles
This repository contains the code and data used for the detection and analysis of glycosylations in extracellular vesicle (EV) proteins and peptides, as supplementary material for the publication:

`A comparative proteomic, transcriptomic and glycomic analysis of extracellular vesicle isolation techniques highlights ExoGAG efficiency for a more complete identification of breast milk molecular signaling pathways Title`

Pereira-Hern√°ndez *et al*.

# Workflow
The complete workflow and required dependencies for this analysis are described in `scripts/README.md`.


# Description
This project analyzes the performance of different EV isolation techniques (ExoGAG, IP CD9, SEC, UC) for detecting glycosylated proteins and peptides. The analysis focuses on identifying:

- The total number of proteins and peptides detected by each technique.
- Proteins and peptides present in the Vesiclepedia database.
- Proteins and peptides with specific glycosylations.

The results include statistical analyses (Kruskal-Wallis and *post hoc* Dunn's test if the former is significant) and visualizations (boxplots and pie charts) that allow for comparing the performance of the different techniques.
