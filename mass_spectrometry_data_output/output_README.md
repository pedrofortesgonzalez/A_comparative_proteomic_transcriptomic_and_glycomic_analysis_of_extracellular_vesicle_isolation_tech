## Mass Spectrometry Output

The `mass_spectrometry_data_output` directory contains representative results generated by this pipeline. 

When you run the analysis on your own data, a complete set of results will be generated 
in a new `../output` directory.

In case of running multiple analyses, be sure to rename/move each new `output` folder, or it will be overwritten with every new execution of the pipeline.
